# Today I Learned

It is always good to be learning and using new tools.

I had already checked out the notion but had not really used it.
I started using it more often, creating everything very similar to Trello, I created new pages, a study guide and I'm impressed with how versatile, organized and clean Notion is.

I really like organized pages and the minimalist style, and notion has it all.

I leave here a map that will guide me in building frontend, backend and mobile applications, that is, I will use it whenever I create a new project, it will be my guide.
