# Today I Learned

Today I learned how important it's for us to submit our codes to code reviews, I don't know if you do it daily or if you've ever done it, but it's something very important.
Thanks to a code review today I was able to improve my code even more, and we prevent an error that a developer created in another branch, affecting the entire project.

### About COVID-19

Today here in Brazil we are in 2,201 confirmed cases and 46 deaths, and unfortunately we see the numbers growing more and more. England, for example, went into full quarantine today, and Spain is still suffering from a health meltdown.

Unfortunately it's a very sad situation that we have been through, but it's even more important to do our part, and each one staying at home is already helping their neighbor.
